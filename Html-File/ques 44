44) Develop a music playlist management system for a streaming service. The system should allow
users to
create, modify, and organize playlists. How would you use arrays and array functions to store and
manipulate the song data and playlist information efficiently?
&lt;?php
$songs = array(&quot;Shape of You&quot;, &quot;Blinding Lights&quot;, &quot;Believer&quot;, &quot;Levitating&quot;);
$playlist = array();
array_push($playlist, $songs[0], $songs[2], $songs[3]);
echo &quot;&lt;h3&gt;My Playlist&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;;
foreach ($playlist as $song) {
echo $song . &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
}
$key = array_search(&quot;Believer&quot;, $playlist);
if ($key !== false) {
unset($playlist[$key]);
}
echo &quot;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Total Songs: &quot; . count($playlist);
?&gt;
OUTPUT:
My Playlist
Shape of You
Believer
Levitating

Summary
Total Songs: 2
