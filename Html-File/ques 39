39) A school wants to automate the calculation of student grades. Design a system that allows
teachers to input
student scores, calculates their grades, and generates a summary report. How would you utilize
arrays and
array functions to store and process the student data effectively?
&lt;?php
$students = array(
&quot;Alice&quot; =&gt; 85,
&quot;Bob&quot; =&gt; 72,
&quot;Charlie&quot; =&gt; 90,
&quot;David&quot; =&gt; 65,
&quot;Eva&quot; =&gt; 50
);
function getGrade($score) {
if ($score &gt;= 90) return &quot;A&quot;;
elseif ($score &gt;= 80) return &quot;B&quot;;
elseif ($score &gt;= 70) return &quot;C&quot;;
elseif ($score &gt;= 60) return &quot;D&quot;;
else return &quot;F&quot;;
}
echo &quot;&lt;h3&gt;Student Grade Report&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;;
foreach ($students as $name =&gt; $score) {
$grade = getGrade($score);
echo &quot;$name - Score: $score - Grade: $grade &lt;br&gt;&quot;;
}
$totalStudents = count($students);
$totalScore = array_sum($students);
$average = $totalScore / $totalStudents;
$highest = max($students);
$lowest = min($students);
$topper = array_keys($students, $highest);

echo &quot;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Total Students: $totalStudents &lt;br&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Average Score: $average &lt;br&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Highest Score: $highest (Topper: &quot; . implode(&quot;, &quot;, $topper) . &quot;)&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
echo &quot;Lowest Score: $lowest &lt;br&gt;&quot;;
?&gt;
OUTPUT:
Student Grade Report
Alice - Score: 85 - Grade: B
Bob - Score: 72 - Grade: C
Charlie - Score: 90 - Grade: A
David - Score: 65 - Grade: D
Eva - Score: 50 - Grade: F

Summary
Total Students: 5
Average Score: 72.4
Highest Score: 90 (Topper: Charlie)
Lowest Score: 50
