71. Tell the different file handling modes available in PHP?
&lt;?php
$file = fopen(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); // Read mode
$file_write = fopen(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;); // Write mode
$file_append = fopen(&quot;example.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;); // Append mode

echo &quot;File handling modes in PHP are: \n&quot;;
echo &quot;r = Read, w = Write, a = Append.&quot;;
?&gt;
OUTPUT:
File handling modes in PHP are:
r = Read, w = Write, a = Append.
