22. Create a PHP script that counts the number of occurrences of a specific word in a given
string.

&lt;?php
$text = &quot;PHP is easy. PHP is powerful. I love PHP!&quot;;
$word = &quot;PHP&quot;;

$count = substr_count($text, $word);

echo &quot;The word &#39;$word&#39; appears $count times.&quot;;
?&gt;

output:
The word &#39;PHP&#39; appears 3 times.
