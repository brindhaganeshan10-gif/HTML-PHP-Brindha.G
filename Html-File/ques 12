&lt;?php
$marks = 68;

echo &quot;Marks: $marks&quot;;
echo &quot;Grade: &quot;;

if ($marks &gt;= 75) {
echo &quot;First Class&quot;;
} elseif ($marks &gt;= 60 &amp;&amp; $marks &lt; 75) {
echo &quot;Second Class&quot;;
} elseif ($marks &gt;= 40 &amp;&amp; $marks &lt; 60) {

echo &quot;Third Class&quot;;
} else {
echo &quot;Fail&quot;;
