41) How can you use regular expressions to extract all email addresses from a given string using an
array in
PHP?
&lt;?php
$text = &quot;Contact us at support@example.com, sales@shop.org or admin123@test.co.in for details.&quot;;
$pattern = &quot;/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}/&quot;;
preg_match_all($pattern, $text, $matches);
$emails = $matches[0];
echo &quot;Extracted Email Addresses:&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
foreach ($emails as $email) {
echo $email . &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;
}
?&gt;
OUTPUT:
Extracted Email Addresses:
support@example.com
sales@shop.org
admin123@test.co.in
